## Minimum Cost Path for the Vehicle Refueling

Your objective is to construct a search algorithm to find the minimum time path through the network of vehicle supercharging stations. Each supercharger will refuel the vehicle at a different rate
given in km/hr of charge time. Your route does not have to fully charge at every visited charger, so long as it never runs out of charge between two chargers. 


You will be provided with a code skeleton which includes a header with the charger network data
in the format:

	name, latitude in degrees, longitude in degrees, charge rate in km/hr

You may compare your solutions against our reference implementation using the provided
"checker" programs in either OSX or linux, make sure to use it to check your submission output
against several different start and end chargers


Input: Your program should take as input two strings: “start charger name”, “end charger name"


Output: Your program’s only output should be a print to std::out of a string in the format:

		initial charger name, first charger name, charge time in hrs, 
		second charger name, charge time in hrs, …, …, goal charger name

	this is the format required by the checker program as well, for example the command

		./solution Council_Bluffs_IA Cadillac_MI 

	might return:

		Council_Bluffs_IA, Worthington_MN, 1.18646, Albert_Lea_MN, 1.90293, Onalaska_WI, 
		0.69868, Mauston_WI, 1.34287, Sheboygan_WI, 1.69072, Cadillac_MI
	
	You can check the solution by providing your output to the included checker, for example
		
		./checker_osx “Council_Bluffs_IA, Worthington_MN, 1.18646, Albert_Lea_MN, 1.90293, 
		Onalaska_WI, 0.69868, Mauston_WI, 1.34287, Sheboygan_WI, 1.69072, Cadillac_MI”
	
	will return 
		
		Finding Path Between Council_Bluffs_IA and Cadillac_MI
		Reference result: Success, cost was 17.2531
		Candidate result: Success, cost was 17.2548


You should make the following assumptions:

	The car begins at the start charger with a full charge of 320km
	The car travels at a constant speed of 105km/hr along great circle routes between chargers
	The Earth is a sphere of radius 6356.752km

Evaluation Metrics:

	Path satisfiability (car remains above 0km of range throughout entire trip)
	Path optimality (total time driving + charging)
	Coding structure
	Code clarity
	Computational cost


Ensure that your solution compiles under gcc 4.8.4 with optimization level 1:

	g++ -std=c++11 -O1 main.cpp network.cpp -o solution


The solution needs to be self-contained with just the use of STL algorithms (i.e. do not use off-the-shelf packages).
